          I always thought my dream was to become an excellent business development manager for a local small-to-medium enterprise, 
          building relationship and negotiating with external partners and stakeholders.It seems like an appropriate journey given my cumulative experience 
          over the years. But i felt like something was missing. I longed to learn more, yearned to learn something different.

            During the global pandemic, i was laid off due to the social and economic impacts of Covid-19. So I spontaneously took a course at NTU/Skillsunion on a whim 
            to try something new. And then it happened; the spark I was missing ignited my curiosity the moment I clicked play on my first javascript terminal. (I mean 
            seriously, how could it not be awesome when Google, YouTube, Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter were developed with JavaScript). Since then, i could not get 
            enough. Information technology appeals to all of my passions which I'm able to incorporate creativity and problem solving along with breaking the code to optimize the code.

              I strongly believe that technology makes a difference in the entire industries as well as in the lives of people around the world, that is why I am currently
              pursuing my IT degree in SUSS. I anticipate that this new journey will be a rewarding endeavour, knowing that my daily work is going to leave a positive 
              impact on others while contributing to the growing network of technology we all rely on.

                My specialties includes quickly learning new skills and programming languages, problem solving, and related principles. 
                So far I have learned JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, GIT/Github, Heroku, MySQL/Postgres/MongoDB, Node.JS, Express.JS. 
                I have started with Python and will certainly be just as enthusiastic about reaching for other programming languages, frameworks, or principles 
                that I hope to integrate into the programming cobwebs in my brain.
